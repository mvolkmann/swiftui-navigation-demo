# swiftui-navigation-demo

This demonstrates the new SwiftUI navigation API added in iOS 16.
Note the use of `NavigationStack`, `NavigationLink`, and the `navigationDestination` modifier.
One of the advantages of this new approach is that it is easy to pop back to the root view in a nested view hierarchy.
